# Contributing
This file is made as a set of guidelines for contributors to ensure that the contributions provided are up to standard.

### Commit messages
Commit messages are expected to have following prefixes in square brackets followed by short summary of the change in the commit:
- docs - In case file in src/docs is changed
<!-- FIXME: Add more definitions-->

Which would make the commit messages look like:
```
[docs] Change header to be more readable
```

### Squashing
Make sure to squash all commits before requesting review
